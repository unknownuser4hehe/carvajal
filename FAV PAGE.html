	Ichigo lost his mother when he was young and blamed himself for it.<br>
	This tragedy is a deep part of his character, in how he's so protective of his friends<br>
	and family,and especially respectful<br>
	to theghosts he sees in his daily life.

	Himeno's entire body vanishes, leaving only her clothes behind.<br>

	regenerating him and allowing him to fight in her place.<br> 
	Later in the hospital, Aki mourns Himeno's death.

	in exchange for sacrificing her right eye permanently to the devil,<br>
	Himeno could summon and control the right arm of the Ghost Devil<br>
	by making the desired motions with her own right arm,<br>
	which the ghost will mimic.

	<a name="a2">Naruto</a><br>	
	His parents died on the night he was born during the Nine-Tails' rampage,<br>
	making him an orphan from the beginning of his life.<br>

	Naruto's father managed to seal the fox within him before he died,<br>
	and this made Naruto's life even harder.
	<br>
	<br>
	As a child, Naruto was neglected and was only acknowledged as a monster and,<br>
	demon boy who shouldn't be alive, let alone a Shinobi.<br>
	He grew up without any parents, without the love of another person.<br>
	In fact, Naruto has been entirely alone his entire life.,<br>
